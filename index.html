                I am a working mom. I have 2 daughters and 2 dogs. 
                I became a full time student again during pandemic and recently finished my AA degree in Real Estate. 
                I am now trying to complete the Cybersecurity Certificate at El Camino. I am also a Microsoft certified professional, but that program is now discontinued.
